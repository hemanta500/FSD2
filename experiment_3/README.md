# 🧪 Experiment Report: Basic Single Page Application (SPA)

## 🎯 Objective

To design and develop a basic **Single Page Application (SPA)** using a modern frontend framework and understand its structure, build process, and deployment workflow.

---

## 🛠️ Software / Tools Used

- **Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Package Manager:** `npm`
- **Deployment Platform:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

---

## 📄 Project Description

This project is built using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool.

Vite provides a fast development environment with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and an optimized production build. The project follows modern frontend development practices while keeping the structure simple and easy to understand.

The main goal is to understand how Single Page Applications (SPA) work using modern tooling.

### ✨ Project Features

- **Fast development** using Vite
- **Component-based UI** using React
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for instant updates
- **Optimized production build**
- **Ready for deployment** on Netlify

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this experiment, I have achieved the following:

- **Project Structure:** Understood the internal folders and files of a React app created via Vite.
- **Tooling Proficiency:** Learned to build and run React projects using modern build tools.
- **Environment Logic:** Successfully differentiated between **Development Mode** (HMR) and **Production Build** (Minification).
- **Deployment:** Mastered deploying a React application on Netlify using the `dist` folder.
- **Architectural Insight:** Gained a clear understanding of the **Single Page Application (SPA)** working concept.

## 🏗️ Build and Deployment

### 1. Development Mode

To start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```
